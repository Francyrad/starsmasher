questions.

OBTAINING AND COMPILING
-----------------------

To get the code, first get an account on carrv109.allegheny.edu and ask Jamie
to open up connections to carrv109 from your preferred IP address.  Then issue the commands

   mkdir starsmasher
   cd starsmasher	
   svn co svn+ssh://your_username@carrv109.allegheny.edu/var/svn/starsmasher ./starsmasher

from the directory where you want the installation to occur.  (In what
follows, I'll assume the installation was done in the subdirectory starsmasher
of your home directory.)  Then

   cd starsmasher

This main directory contains at least four subdirectories:

example_input:          contains example input files for various cases
misc:			miscellaneous files such as assorted makefiles and the StarCrash manual
parallel_bleeding_edge: latest version of code (this is probably what you want)
splot_directories:	post-simulation code used for data extraction and analysis


For runs on a gpu-enabled cluster, the directory you care about is
parallel_bleeding_edge.  Let's try to compile the code in there:

   cd parallel_bleeding_edge/src/SPHgrav_lib

The SPHgrav_lib subdirectory contains code written by Evghenii Gaburov
(and somewhat modified by Jamie Lombardi and Sam Knarr) for
calculating softened gravitational forces and potentials on NVIDIA
GPUs.  If you are running on something other than keeneland, you will
need to customize the Makefile for your system: any path that contains
"cuda" or "CUDA" probably needs to be changed.  To make the library,
simply issue the command

   make

(The final thing that make does is "./makelib.sh" which is what will make the
library.)  If it doesn't work, and you want to have a fresh start,
first use "make clean".  If all goes well the library
libGPUsph_gatherscatter.a will be generated.

The SPH source code is in the .. directory.  This is a parallel code.
Execute

   cd ..

so that you're in the src subdirectory.  Then

   cp makefile.keeneland makefile

To compile, type

   make

You will likely need to customize the makefile for your computer.  For
example, you may need to change the compiler or update paths to point
to the appropriate locations.  The executable name will end with _sph
and will depend on the name of the directory that src appears within.
The executable will automatically be moved up a level in the directory
structure (that is, to the ".."  directory).  You probably want to
remove the executable for now so that you don't later copy it to other
places where you don't want it:

   cd ..
   rm *_sph

Although this Starsmasher code is not well documented, there is
documentation for Starcrash, which is a previous version of this code
(see http://ciera.northwestern.edu/StarCrash/).  Although Starcrash is
not the same as Starsmasher, the variable names, input files, output
files, and parallelization strategy is very similar.  The Starcrash
documentation is available as the file usersmanual.pdf in the
misc subdirectory and may be somewhat helpful to peruse.  You will
be most interested in pages 31 - 36, which talks about input and
output.  Remember, however, that this Starsmasher SPH code is different in
many ways.  The algorithms of Starsmasher are mostly described in
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.402..105G.  The AV scheme is
described in Ponce et al. (2011).


EXAMPLE RUNS
------------

There are two steps to modelling a collision or fly-by of two stars.
First, you have to model the individual star: a relaxation run.
Second, you simulate the interaction: a dynamical calculation.

Step 1: Relaxation runs
-----------------------

Step 1(a): Relaxing a n=1.5 polytrope
-------------------------------------

Let's have you do your own simulation for practice.  We'll use N=1000,
so that the code runs very quickly.  Let's try an equation of state
governed by the adiabatic index gamma=5/3, and a structure specified
by the polytropic index n=1.5.

First, get the directories ready:
   cd ..  ####   or maybe "cd ~/starsmasher" depending on where your installation is
   cp -r parallel_bleeding_edge GAM1.667_n1.5
   cd GAM1.667_n1.5
   cp ../example_input/relaxation_preMS/sph.in* .
The file sph.init controls what type of calculation we will do.
Confirm that the three letter code word inside sph.init is '1es' for
this polytrope relaxation (and update the text if necessary):
   emacs -nw sph.init
You should look at sph.input:
   emacs -nw sph.input #### [or use some other editor]
Change line 4 of sph.input to be N=2000 and save the file.  There are
several other variables that could be changed, but the defaults should
be fine for now.  See the Starcrash documentation for an explanation
of what some of the other variables are.

Now let's compile the source code:
   cd src
   cat sphu.h
Confirm that the last line sets the adiabatic index GAM=5.d0/3.d0.
   emacs -nw initialize_polyes.f
Confirm that the lines right after the declaration section will set the
polytropic constant npoly to be 1.5.
The radius and mass are set on near here.  These values are
in physical units of runit and munit, which are set at the end of sph.input
and are typically the radius and mass of the sun in cgs units.  Save initialize_polyes.f
when done and then try to compile:
   make
Once everything goes well with the
compilation, the last line you should see is "mv GAM1.667_n1.5_sph
..".  Get positioned to run the code:
   cd ..
and get a good batch script if you don't have one
   cp ../sph.pbs.kfs sph.pbs
The default sph.pbs file asks for only 1 minute, so you'll need to
change that for a real run.  To run the code,
   qsub -q debug sph.pbs ### or, for long jobs, "qsub sph.pbs"
This creates, among other things, a file log0.sph that collects
ascii tex about the run.

Step 1(b): Relaxing a TWIN model
--------------------------------

Get the directories ready:
   cd ~/starsmasher   ### or cd to wherever your main installation is
   cp -r parallel_bleeding_edge TWIN
   cd TWIN
   cp ../example_input/relaxation_TWIN_model/* .

To relax a TWIN model instead, the three letter code word in sph.init
should be 'erg'.  The SPH code will look for a model named
'eg.last1.muse_s2mm'.  You can create a symbolic link from an
appropriate output file of TWIN if you like (e.g.,
"cp -s m_8_t_5.7.last1.muse_s2mm eg.last1.muse_s2mm").  The file
m_8_t_5.7.last1.muse_s2mm is the default in
example_input/relaxation_TWIN_model.  It represents an 8M_sun MS
star at t=5.7Myr.

The sph.input file, also available within
example_input/relaxation_TWIN_model/, should be similar to the
sph.input file used above for the polytrope (probably just change N
and nothing else unless necessary).  The file on the svn site does
have TRELOFF to 200 in this case, to make sure there was enough time
for oscillations to die off, and TF is 300 so the star could be
monitored for 100 time units after the relaxation was turned off.

Run the code like before:
   cd src
   make
   cd ..
   cp ../sph.pbs.kfs ./sph.pbs
   qsub -q debug sph.pbs

Step 2: Dynamical calculation
-----------------------------

If the model from the relaxation run at t=TRELOFF looks good, then you
can use that to start a dynamical calculation.  Start by get the
directories ready:
  cd ~/starsmasher   ### or cd to wherever your main installation is
  cp -r parallel_bleeding_edge/ collision_rp3.9_a119
  cd collision_rp3.9_a119
  cp ../example_input/collision/sph.in* .
  emacs -nw sph.init
Make sure the second line of sph.init says INAME='hyp'.

The new sph.input file is set up for doing dynamical calculations.
Take a look at it:
  emacs -nw sph.input
While you're in the file, check that DTOUT=1 on line 3, which
means that an out*.sph file will be dumped every 1 time unit.  Also,
on line 16 or so, make BIMPACT=3.9d0, which means the periastron separation
of the initial orbit is 3.9 stellar radii.

In sph.input you can use any of the following pairs of data to initialize a collision in hyperbolic.f: (e0,vinf2), (e0,bimpact), (semimajoraxis,bimpact), (semimajoraxis,e0), (bimpact,vinf2).  Here e0 is the eccentricity of the initial orbit, and bimpact is the periastron separation (not really the impact parameter).  For example, sph.input could contain

 BIMPACT=4.d0,
 semimajoraxis=118.57d0,

and e0 and vinf2 could be unspecified.  Or you could specify BIMPACT and e0, and the same code works, etc.  The code in initialize_hyperbolic.f figures out what it needs to solve for.

Whether the encounter is hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptical is
controlled by the velocity at infinity squared, vinf2, or the semimajoraxis a.
The value of vinf2 is negative for elliptical encounters, zero for
parabolic encounters, and positive for hyperbolic encounters.  Note
that the orbital energy G*M*mu/(-2a) just equals mu*vinf2/2.
Therefore, there is a simple relation between the semimahor axis a and
vinf2, namely.  a=-G*M/vinf2, where M is the total mass of the two
stars.  For example, if you are colliding a 0.3 Msun and 8Msun star
and if vinf2=-0.07, then the semimajor axis a=(0.3+8)/0.07=118.57,
where I assume the units chosen are the usual G=Msun=Rsun=1.

Note that ngravprocs=-6 and ppn=16... this means there are
abs(ngravprocs)=6 GPU units per 16 CPU cores, as on one node of the
supercomputer forge.  You should change these values to be appropriate
for your machine.  For example, on Keeneland KFS, there are 3 gpus and
12 cores per node.

Let's get the star models:
  cp ../TWIN/*/out0200.sph ./sph.start1u
  cp ../GAM1.667_n1.5/*/out0100.sph ./sph.start2u
where we assume the 8 solar mass ZAMS star was relaxed in the directory ../TWIN/.
Now let's compile the code:
  cd src
  make
To run the code, get to the same directory as the executable:
  cd ..
then
  cp ../sph.pbs.kfs ./sph.pbs
  qsub -q debug sph.pbs

RESTARTING RUNS
---------------

Every few iterations, a restartrad.sph file is dumped (overwriting any
previously existing restartrad.sph file).  If a restartrad.sph file
exists in the directory when a new run is launched, then the code will
automatically use that file to initiate the calculation.  This is
useful for restarting in the middle of a long simulation.  You can
also restart from any out*.sph file simply by renaming it to
restartrad.sph.

DATA VISUALIZATION
------------------

I recommend Price's SPLASH software.  It will need to be customized to
read in our output file type.
