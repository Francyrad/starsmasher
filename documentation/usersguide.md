## Introduction

  Hello there, welcome to our public release of *StarSmasher*- a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) based, parallel code. *StarSmasher* has been developed and maintained by James Lombardi with help from many others. *StarSmasher* is a code that evolved from a code created and maintained by Joshua Faber, James Lombardi, and Fred Rasio called *StarCrash*, and much of this guide is directly from the guide for *StarCrash*. My name is Sarah Seitanakis, and I will help you get to know our code-- so that you, too, can become a StarSmasher. 

  The following sections of this guide will include installation instructions, a discription of portions of the code (such as some background on SPH, parallelization techniques, and physical effects), and we will wrap it up with an overview of how to properly use the code- and even add your own routines. 
  
  While this code is being freely distributed, we ask that you please give appropriate credit to those who have spent a great deal of time developing it. If you are going to publish work done with this code, please see Sec. 8 for the proper references to cite, as well as the license agreement we are using, the rather ubiquitous Gnu General Public License (GPL).
